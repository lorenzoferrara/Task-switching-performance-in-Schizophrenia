PC1 

ANTERIOR Cingulate Gyrus
Emotions
Decision Making[1]
cognitive functions, such as reward anticipation, decision-making, empathy, and emotion.
Difficult dilemmas tend to elicit increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region associated with "response conflict."[4]
activity of the anterior cingulate cortex increases in tasks involving cognitive control (such as error detection, conflict monitoring, and/or dual tasks for attention and tests for the executive component of working memory)

CAUDATE NUCLEUS
execution of movement, but also in learning, memory, reward, motivation, emotion, and romantic interaction 
the caudate nucleus contributes to behaviour through the excitation of correct action schemas and the selection of appropriate sub-goals based on an evaluation of action-outcomes; both processes fundamental to successful goal-directed action. 

PUTAMEN
motor planning, learning, and execution,[3] motor preparation,[4] specifying amplitudes of movement,[5] and movement sequences
BUT ALSO: rule-based tasks, Category learning

SUPERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS
higher cognitive functions and particularly to working memory

PC2

Nucleus accumbens
processing of motor function related to reward and reinforcement
the core encodes new motor programs which facilitate the acquisition of a given reward in the future => MEMORIA MUSCOLARE

The superior parietal lobule
has close links with the occipital lobe and is involved in aspects of attention and visuospatial perception, including the representation and manipulation of objects.

subcallosal area
suppression of amygdala responsiveness to fearful cues, repress anxiety


subgenual prefrontal cortex
emotional regulation and reward mechanisms.
